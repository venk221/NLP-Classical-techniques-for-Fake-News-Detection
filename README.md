#Fake News Detection using NLP and Machine Learning Techniques#
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for a machine learning project focused on detecting fake news articles using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The project explores different feature engineering approaches, including Bag of Words, TF-IDF, and enhanced NLP techniques like using nouns and adjectives only. Additionally, several machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, are employed for the classification task.

##Project Overview
The proliferation of fake news and misinformation on social media and online platforms has become a significant concern, with potential consequences ranging from influencing public opinion to shaping political outcomes. This project aims to develop an effective tool for accurately classifying news articles as either real or fake, leveraging NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze the text content and other relevant features.

##Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains news articles labeled as either real or fake. The dataset is preprocessed and cleaned, including steps such as removing HTML tags, handling missing values, and performing text normalization.

##Approach
The project explores the following approaches:

###Data Preprocessing
The news article data is cleaned and preprocessed, including steps like removing HTML tags, handling missing values, and performing text normalization.

###Feature Engineering
1. Bag of Words (BoW): Convert the text data into a matrix of token counts, representing the frequency of each word in the corpus.
2. TF-IDF: Calculate the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores, which capture the importance of words in the corpus while accounting for their rarity.

###Enhanced NLP Techniques: Extract features using advanced NLP techniques, such as considering only nouns and adjectives from the text data.
###Machine Learning Algorithms
1.Naive Bayes: Train a Naive Bayes classifier on the feature vectors obtained from the feature engineering techniques.
2.Random Forest: Train a Random Forest classifier on the feature vectors obtained from the feature engineering techniques.
3.Decision Tree: Train a Decision Tree classifier on the feature vectors obtained from the feature engineering techniques.

##Model Evaluation
The trained models are evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on a held-out test set.

##Model Comparison
Compare the performance of different models and feature engineering techniques to identify the most effective approach for fake news detection.

##Results
The results section of the Jupyter Notebook presents the performance of the various machine learning models and feature engineering techniques on the fake news detection task. Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, are reported for both the training and test sets. The notebook provides insights into the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach, highlighting the most effective combinations of feature engineering and machine learning algorithms for the given dataset.
